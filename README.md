oUF_Porcelain
=============

New attempted raiding oUF lay-out, tailored towards DPS. (Sorry to all you healers and tanks. Tanks should be ok though.)

I started by creating the config file, roughly based on oUF_Skaarj, because I  liked the positioning and way of things in his/her layout.

Currently I have support for :
- Player, target
- Focus, target of target
- Boss
- Raid
- Party
- Pet

To do :
- Castbar with latency check
- Maintank + targets
- Boss + targets
- Aura Filtering (I really do only care about my debuffs - since I don't use a debuff tracker)

What will NOT make a happy appearance:
- Arena frames (I apologize, but I suck at pvp and thus can't even test arena frames properly)
